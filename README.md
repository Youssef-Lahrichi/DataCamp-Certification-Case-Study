# DataCamp-Certification-Case-Study

This is the case study I completed in 24 hours to recieve my Professional Data Scientist certification from DataCamp. It's not perfect, but I wanted to showcase the work that I completed in just the 24 hour time frame. In the future, I plan on working on it further and uploading an updated copy.
